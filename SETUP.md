## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

    cd conference-booking
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies (if any). Currently, no additional setup is required for the frontend.
   
    For EXPRESS

    cd c:\Users\---\---\chool\backend  {Navagate and Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder}
    npm install express
    node server.js

4. Run the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`. You can access the frontend through your browser.
